## Restaurant Management Guide – How to Manage a Restaurant:<a name="a"></a>

    If you own a restaurant, you know the importance of providing great tasting food and enjoyable customer experience. However, this is merely the start of what you need to do when managing a restaurant.
    Restaurant management is just like running any other business; you need to take care of all aspects of the organization to ensure it runs smoothly.
    This is equally the case for small restaurants with just a handful of staff as it is for large chains with multiple outlets.
    One difference is that a smaller restaurant may not have the resources to hire employees to perform each task, leaving a lot of the responsibility on the owner and making restaurant management difficult. 
    This can be especially daunting if they don’t have any formal restaurant management experience.
    If you are a restaurant manager looking for tips about how to improve your business, then look no further. This article is a full guide that will detail how to manage a restaurant.


### 1. Mission Statement and Strategy<a name="b"></a>
      In most cases, coming up with a mission statement for your restaurant is straightforward. You just need to be clear about why you set up your restaurant, what sets you apart, and what you hope to achieve. Some mission statements from famous restaurants are:
      In-N-Out Burger: Serve only the highest quality product, prepare it in a clean and sparkling environment, and serve it in a warm and friendly manner.
      Panda Express: To deliver exceptional Asian dining experiences by building an organization where people are inspired to better their lives.
      While the mission statement is relatively simple, things get a little bit more complicated when it comes to a business’s strategy. Writing in the Harvard Business Review, Michael D. Watkins defines a business strategy as:

      “a set of guiding principles that, when communicated and adopted in the organization, generates a desired pattern of decision making. A strategy is, therefore, about how people throughout the organization should make decisions and allocate resources in order to accomplish key objectives.”

      Basically, a strategy is a roadmap that defines how a business’s mission will be accomplished. It will tell you what to prioritize and will drive the decisions that you make. Your mission and strategy will influence all parts of your restaurant management, as every decision you make should be, on some level, one that will push you towards achieving your mission.
   
### 2. Managing Production<a name="c"></a>
       Restaurants produce two things: food and experience. Managing production comes down to creating an experience and menu that will bring in customers and allow the restaurant to operate at a profitable level.

####   Food<a name="F"></a>
           Producing great food that aligns with your mission statement is arguably the most important part of managing a restaurant. However, doing so in a way that can drive your business to success is the ultimate aim. Because of this, it is important that you get menu pricing right.

####   How to Price Your Menu<a name="How"></a>
           Most restaurants will make most of, if not all, their money through the menu. Price your items too low and you won’t make enough money to survive. Price your food too high and you’ll limit the number of customers who come to your restaurant.

           There are many things you should consider when pricing your menu, including your restaurant’s positioning and the cost of ingredients.

           When pricing menu items it is important to set the prices at a level that will provide enough profit for your restaurant to be successful based on the anticipated number of customers and the cost of running it.

           Calculating how much it costs to produce each item on your menu shouldn’t be too problematic – simply tot up the price of all the raw ingredients that go into each item on the menu. This must be accurate: if your avocado salad uses a third of an avocado, you need to work out exactly how much this amount of avocado costs.
           Once you have worked out how much an item on your menu costs to produce, you can price it at a level that will generate enough profit.

           Jonathan Deutsch, a Food Studies professor at Drexel University, says many restaurants aim for food costs to come in at around 30 to 35 percent of the menu price. However, he points out that this may differ if a restaurant has particularly high operating costs, such as rent and staff, or if it sells a high volume of lower cost food.

           Alternatively, restaurants that make a lot of money from drinks or events may not mind a slightly lower profit margin on some food items to get people through the door.

           Your food costs are unlikely to be uniform across the menu. Some items will have higher base costs while others will come in lower. Think about grouping high-cost items with low-cost ones to balance this out. You could do this through set menus or offers.
        
####    Keep Your Menu Pricing Up to Date<a name="Kepp"></a>
           Costs of ingredients change frequently. Because of this, you should ensure your menu prices reflect this.

           You’ll have to balance any price increases with potential backlash from customers. Perhaps swap out menu items that are becoming too unprofitable with new items to avoid this. By putting the focus on the excitement of the new item, regular customers may be less annoyed by the change than if you simply raise prices.

####    How do Your Prices Fit in With the Competition?<a name="Prices"></a>
           A final thing to think about is competitor pricing. If a competitor is selling pasta dishes for between £11 and £15, you may struggle to sell yours in the £18 to £22 range unless you have other ways of differentiating yourself. This is problematic if that’s how much you need to sell them for in order to be profitable.

           You do have options, however. Think about swapping out expensive items for cheaper ones or reducing the number of pasta dishes you sell so you can buy certain items in bulk at a lower cost. Alternatively, you could reduce the profit margin on the pasta dishes but increase it on some of your other items.

           Understand the Customer Experience
               While your food may be the bedrock of your restaurant, the overall customer experience is arguably as important when creating a successful business. Good restaurant managers will take steps to understand the current customer experience and ensure their restaurant provides a great one.

               Reports have listed the importance of customer experience to customer spending and loyalty. For example (via Benbria.com):

               An American Express survey found that 7 out of 10 consumers spent more money with a company that delivers great service.
               The Harvard Business School found a one-star increase in a restaurant’s Yelp rating correlated with a revenue increase of between five and nine percent.
               New Voice Media found 51 percent of customers will cut ties with a business after a single bad experience.
               In an OpenTable report, 69 percent of diners said complementary extras would increase customer loyalty, while 65 percent said seating preferences would do the same.
               There are several things you can do to understand the customer experience. Asking diners to provide feedback through surveys is one method. Alternatively, you could check reviews on websites like Trip Advisor to see if any trends appear that could point to your restaurants’ strengths or weaknesses.

               Finally, speaking to staff that regularly deal with customers could provide insight into what it is like to eat at your restaurant.

####    How to Produce a Great Customer Experience<a name="Product"></a>
            A 2017 Deloitte survey into customer experience identified five things that diners want restaurants to provide. These are over and above the basics of quality food, good value, great staff, a convenient location, and cleanliness.

           The five things restaurants can do identified by the survey were:

           Engage the Customer

               The survey found customers thought being engaged by staff at the restaurant was important to customers. This was especially the case with sit-down meals as the customers spend more time with staff.

           Empower the Customer

               Restaurants can empower customers by providing them with the knowledge they need to make good decisions, as well as the ability to personalize what they order. Personalization was found to be especially important in takeaway and delivery restaurants. It was also the second most important factor in sit-down restaurants.

           Listen to Customers

               This relates to the ability of customers to provide feedback on the restaurant experience. While the survey found that this wasn’t normally especially important, it became more so if anything went wrong during their time at the restaurant.

           Delight the Customer

                Restaurants can delight customers by creating an appealing ambiance or using sustainable practices.

           Know the Customer

                Knowing the customer doesn’t necessarily mean staff being on first name terms. Instead, it relates to restaurants remembering customers and personalizing their experience to make transactions easier. Customers found it to be especially important for takeaway or delivery restaurants.

### 3. Managing Your Employees<a name="d"></a>
        Your employees are an important part of your restaurant. Ensuring you have the right staff, from dishwashers to chefs, can help drive your business to success. Here are some things you should think about when managing your employees.

####  Hire the Right Staff<a name="Hire"></a>
          The first step is to ensure you hire the right people in the first place. When you hire you should look for people who are likely to have a positive influence on your restaurant and fit in with existing employees and culture.

          When publicizing jobs, be clear about the duties of the role and what will be expected. This will reduce confusion later.

####  Train Employees Well<a name="Train"></a>
          The next step is to train your employees to allow them to perform their duties effectively. For restaurant owners or managers with lots of experience, it can be tempting to assume that staff will know how to perform certain less important tasks. However, this may not be the case, especially if the person doesn’t have experience in the restaurant industry.

         One way to ensure all your employees are on the same page is to provide training programs and manuals that they need to complete. These programs will be specific to each role and will contain all the tasks employees need to perform.

         When the employee has learned how to do each task in the program, the trainer — be it a manager or a senior employee — can check the task off the list. This lets everyone in the organization know the training has been completed.

         You could even think about creating short training videos that show employees how to perform tasks. This is a technique that has been used by sandwich chain Arby’s, with their vice president telling Restaurant Business Magazine the company thinks “providing content in the same ways that our restaurant employees are consuming all other content” is important.

####  Clearly Define Employee Roles<a name="Clearly "></a>
         Clearly defining the roles of those who work in your restaurant can ensure everyone knows what they need to do and who they are reporting to at any one time. This way, if an issue arises in your restaurant, your staff know exactly whose responsibility it is to take care of the problem.

         Defining roles is also essential if you are a restaurant owner and you expect to take time off. By designating someone who will be in charge while you are away, and who reports to them – as well as what they should do – your restaurant will be able to survive without you, even if it is only for a short time.

####  Release Work Schedules in a Timely Manner<a name="Release"></a>
         Scheduling is important both for managers and employees. Ideally, you will produce your schedule as far in advance as possible so that employees can confirm they are available when you have asked them to be.

         Additionally, you’ll need to be aware of variations in how busy your restaurant is likely to be. While most weekday evenings may be fairly quiet, if the following day is a public holiday or if there is a large event happening in the area, you may find your restaurant is busier on those days.

        You should be fair with shifts, especially when it comes to weekends or working on holidays. Unless you hire part-time staff with the specific intention of covering these days, you may find it best to rotate who works on these days so people always get at least some of the weekend off (assuming they want it off). Employees need rest.

        A final thing to remember is the legal requirements of the area you work in. You may have staff who want to work every day for as long as possible. However, not only does this risk burnout but it may also be breaking the law if they work over a certain number of hours in a day or a week.
